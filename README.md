# OpenSSL compilation in Visual Studio

This project was inspired by https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/openssl, but unfortunatelly its non standard installation paths prevent usage of some other great tools like cmake.

### Compilation

1. Init/update git submodules
2. Compile
3. Check instructions on https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/openssl/tree/master/SMP if something went wrong
